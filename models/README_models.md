# models
A model is a set of experts.
This path contains different models, each containing experts for each language

Currently we have only two models:

# general
The general model contains all skills which a unmodified susi_server instance loads by default.
It has the basic "world knowledge" of everything. All other skills would be personal or specific to a special user, user group or i.e. a personal home.

# tutorial
The tutorial model contains all skills which can be used to learn the susi skill language.
Because they are so special and maybe double to other general skills, they are here to create a simple sandbox world.
