::description The Walking Affirmations Daily Affirmation skill provides a daily uplifting, positive thought for you to take throughout the day. Affirmations are sentences aimed to affect the conscious and the subconscious mind. The words that combine to create the affirmation, automatically and involuntarily, bring up related mental images into the mind, which could inspire, energize and motivate. Repeating affirmations, and the resultant mental images, affect the subconscious mind, which in turn, influences the behavior, habits, actions and reactions.
